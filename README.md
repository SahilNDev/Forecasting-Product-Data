# Forecasting-Product-Data
This is the repository for the assignment for Internship.
## Requirements
The requirements to run the code is:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
If you don't have any of these is not possible, then you can use Google Colab to run the Notebook.
## Contents
1. `dataset/Training Dataset.csv`: This is the file that contains the data for Products for 11 months (June 2020 to May 2021)
2. `dataset/Test Dataset.csv`: This is the file that contains the data for Products for 1 months (June 2021)
3. `Sahil_Nagaralu_AIML_Assessment.ipynb`: This is the notebook which contains the python code to run the forecasting model.
4. `Sahil_Nagaralu_AIML_Assessment.py`: This is the python code that is being used to run on streamlit website to show the forecasting predictions.
5. `label_encoder.pkl`: The pickle file containing the Label Encoder from the notebook.
6. `model.pkl`: The pickle file containing the Best Model from the notebook.
7. `requirements.txt`: This file contains the required modules to run the code in the notebook.
## Steps
To run the code on local device:
1. ```bash
   git clone
   ```
2. ```bash
   cd Forecasting-Product-Data
   ```
3. ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Now open the `Sahil_Nagaralu_AIML_Assessment.ipynb` file and run all the cells in the notebook.
